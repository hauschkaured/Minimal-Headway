In the past few weeks, I have spent quite some time reading David Marker's _Model Theory: An Introduction_.

# What is Model Theory?

Model theory is a branch of **mathematical logic** centered around models.
A **model** is a structure that (aptly put) models how some theory behaves.
This is a good general heuristic for what models are, but how do they do it?
To answer this, we will explore some of the basic technical details involved.

## Languages

A language is a collection of functions, relations, and constants. 
This is a fairly abstract way of framing something you call a "language", 
so let's come up with an example!

### The integers!

The integers $$ \mathbb{Z} $$ are the numbers $$ \{ 0, 1, -1, 2, -2,...\} $$.
Now let's describe some familiar ideas:
1) we can add and multiply any two integers together and the result is an integer. 
2) we can compare any two integers and obtain a `true` or `false` result.
3) there are certain integers that are particularly important.

Idea 1: This intuitive notion corresponds to defining the following functions:
$$ +(x,y)=x+y $$ and $$*(x,y) = x*y$$. What this means is we take two arbitrary elements in $$ \mathbb{Z} $$ 
and join them together into a single element of $$ \mathbb{Z} $$.
For this reason we say that these functions map an ordered pair to a single element and write their behavior this:
$$ +:Z\times Z \to Z $$ and $$ *:Z\times Z \to Z $$

Idea 2: This intuitive notion should remind us of statements like $2<3$, $2=3$ and so on.
The first statement is `true` but the second statement is `false`.

Idea 3: There is one integer more important than any other. 
That integer is $$ 0 $$. An important fact is the following: 
for any integer $$ x $$, there is an integer $$ y $$ such that $$ x+y = 0 $$.
That integer is known as the **additive inverse** and is more commonly represented by $$ -x$$.
If some number is particularly important to us, we may want to include it in our language. 

So now that we broke the integers down, a possible language for the integers could be $$ \mathcal{L} = \{0,+,=\} $$.
This is just one possible language of many! We choose this one as it has one of each type of symbol.
