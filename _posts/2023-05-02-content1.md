In the past few weeks, I have spent quite some time reading David Marker's _Model Theory: An Introduction_.

# What is Model Theory?

Model theory is a branch of **mathematical logic** centered around models.
A **model** is a structure that (aptly put) models how some theory behaves.
This is a good general heuristic for what models are, but how do they do it?
To answer this, we will explore some of the basic technical details involved.

## Languages

A language is a collection of functions, relations, and constants. 
This is a fairly abstract way of framing something you call a "language", 
so let's come up with an example!

### The integers!

The integers $$ \mathbb{Z} $$ are the numbers $$ \{ 0, 1, -1, 2, -2,...\} $$.
