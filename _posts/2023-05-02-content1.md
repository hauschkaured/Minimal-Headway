In the past few weeks, I have spent quite some time reading David Marker's _Model Theory: An Introduction_.
Here I'll write about what it is and what I've been doing. 

# What is Model Theory?

Model theory is a branch of **mathematical logic** centered around models.
A **model** is a structure that (aptly put) models how some theory behaves.
This is a good general heuristic for what models are, but how do they do it?
To answer this, we will explore some of the basic technical details involved.

## Languages

A language is a collection of functions, relations, and constants. 
This is a fairly abstract way of framing something you call a "language", 
so let's come up with an example!

### The integers!

The integers $$ \mathbb{Z} $$ are the numbers $$ \{ 0, 1, -1, 2, -2,...\} $$.
Now let's describe some familiar ideas:
1) we can add and multiply any two integers together and the result is an integer. 
2) we can compare any two integers and obtain a `true` or `false` result.
3) there are certain integers that are particularly important.

Idea 1: This intuitive notion corresponds to defining the following functions:
$$ +(x,y)=x+y $$ and $$*(x,y) = x*y$$. What this means is we take two arbitrary elements in $$ \mathbb{Z} $$ 
and join them together into a single element of $$ \mathbb{Z} $$.
For this reason we say that these functions map an ordered pair to a single element and write their behavior this:
$$ +:Z\times Z \to Z $$ and $$ *:Z\times Z \to Z $$

Idea 2: This intuitive notion should remind us of statements like $$2<3$$, $$2=3$$ and so on.
The first statement is `true` but the second statement is `false`. The key idea with relations 
is that for some relation, there is a particular set of elements $$ y $$ that satisfy the condition
$$ R(2,y) $$ for instance ($$ 2 $$ is related to $$ y $$). Comparing $$2$$ and $$y$$ under
the relation $$<$$ gives us all the integers $$y$$ that $$2$$ is less than (equivalently, $$y $$ that are greater than $$2$$).

Idea 3: There is one integer more important than any other. 
That integer is $$ 0 $$. An important fact is the following: 
for any integer $$ x $$, there is an integer $$ y $$ such that $$ x+y = 0 $$.
That integer is known as the **additive inverse** and is more commonly represented by $$ -x$$.
If some number is particularly important to us, we may want to include it in our language. 

So now that we broke the integers down, a possible language for the integers could be $$ \mathcal{L} = \{0,+,=\} $$.
This is just one possible language of many! We choose this one as it has one of each type of symbol. 

## What do Models have to do with it?

Well, a model (or a __structure__ as market calls it) is a tuple (like a pair but with arbitrary dimensions)
consisting of a universe (the set of elements we're doing things with) and **interpretations** of all function, relation, and constant symbols.
Why do we distinguish the symbols and the interpretations? 
The symbols don't mean anything on their own. 
It's only by interpreting the symbols through the model we create that we assign them the usual meaning. 
For instance, $$ +:(x,y) =x+y $$ doesn't let us do anything, these are just symbols.
But if we wrote the same statement $x+y$ in our model of the integers, then the function
would be interpreted as integer addition as described above. 

# Closing remarks

This barely scratches the surface of what Model Theory is (and further, does not go into the same level of depth as most other posts on this blog will). 
I hope that this provides some value to the reader.

Take care!
